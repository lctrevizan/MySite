[{"content":"Hello \u0026#x1f44b; My name is Lucas Couri Trevizan, and I am from Brazil. I am currently studying computer science and have decided to create a website and blog to share my thoughts on the current state of technology. This will also help me establish an online presence outside of social media.\nThis blog will be primarily written in English, as it is easier for me to discuss technology-related topics in English. Most of the articles and books I reference are not translated into Portuguese, so writing in English allows me to more effectively communicate my ideas and perspectives.\nAll blog posts written by me are openly licensed under the CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license, unless stated otherwise. This means you are free to:\nShare the content Alter or modify the content in any way you want Use the content to train artificial intelligence (AI) systems In other words, the content on this blog is in the public domain, and you can use it however you see fit without any restrictions or need for attribution. The CC0 license provides the maximum flexibility for reusing and repurposing the material I publish here.\nAny content on this site that is copyrighted belongs to their respective owners. If the code or content is licensed under a different license outside of this site, then that license takes precedence.\nIn other words:\nCopyrighted content belongs to the original copyright holders, not this site. If the code or content has a specific license applied to it (e.g. MIT, GPL, etc.) that is different from the overall site license, then that external license is the one that applies, not the site-wide license.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/start/","summary":"A post to start everything, because everything needs a start.","title":"A Beginning"},{"content":"Debscripts Debscripts is a collection of scripts that I use to set up and run Debian and Ubuntu servers and desktops.
