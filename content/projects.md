## [This site](https://github.com/lctrevizan/MySite)

This website was created by me using the Hugo static site generator and the PaperMod theme for Hugo. 

It has posts, search, tags and categories as well as links to my socials. 

## [Debscripts](https://github.com/lctrevizan/debscripts)

Debscripts is a collection of scripts that I use to set up and run Debian and Ubuntu servers and desktops. The scripts include:

- Setting up the base system and creating my user account
- Installing necessary packages
- Installing Docker
- Installing Syncthing
- Installing Netmaker

These scripts help automate the process of configuring new Debian or Ubuntu systems according to my preferences and requirements.
